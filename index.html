                    <img src="images/image1.png" alt="reactjs vs nextjs (image)">
                    <p>
                        In the vast world of web development, ReactJS and NextJS stand tall as two powerful tools garnering significant attention. ReactJS, born from Facebook, is a JavaScript library for crafting user interfaces. On the other hand, NextJS, built atop ReactJS, is a framework that facilitates server-side rendering and other advanced functionalities. Despite their differing purposes, ReactJS and NextJS share fundamental similarities that make them a dynamic duo in the realm of web development.

                <section class="main-section">
                    <h2>What is ReactJS?</h2>
                    <img src="images/react-image.png" alt="ReactJS image">
                    <p class="first-p">React is a framework that employs Webpack to automatically compile React, JSX, and ES6 code while handling CSS file prefixes. React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.</p>
                    <p class="second-p">React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI.</p>
                    <h2>Why React?</h2>
                    <p class="third-p">React's popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end development frameworks. Here is why:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where coding often gets complex very quickly.</li>
                        <li>Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual DOM compares the components' previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications do. </li>
                        <li>Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and they can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically reduces the application's development time.</li>
                        <li>Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks, you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React's library.</li>
                        <li>Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and easier.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p  class="forth-p">The above reasons more than justify the popularity of the React library and why it is being adopted by a large number of <a href="https://hng.tech/hire">organizations</a> and <a href="https://hng.tech/hire">businesses</a>. Now let's familiarize ourselves with React's features.

                <section class="main-section">
                    <h2>What is NextJS?</h2>
                    <img src="images/next-image.png" alt="NextJS image">
                    <p class="first-p">Next.js is an open-source web development framework created by the private company Vercel providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation.</p>
                    <p class="second-p">The main feature of Next.js is its use of server-side rendering to reduce the burden on web browsers and provide enhanced security. This can be done for any part of the application or the entire system, allowing for content-rich pages to be singled out for server-side rendering. It can also be done only for first-time visitors, to reduce the burden on web browsers that have yet to download any of the site's assets. The "hot reloading" feature detects changes as they are made and re-renders the appropriate pages so the server avoids the need to be restarted. This allows changes made to the application code to be immediately reflected in the web browser, though some browsers will require the page to be refreshed. The software uses page-based routing for developer convenience and includes support for dynamic routing. Other features include hot-module replacement so that modules can be replaced live, automatic code splitting, which only includes code necessary to load the page, and page prefetching to reduce load time.</p>
                    <h2>Why NextJS?</h2>
                    <p class="third-p">Let's have a look at one of those frameworks - Next.js, which enjoys growing popularity and quickly became the first choice for many big names and companies.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Turbopack replaces Webpack for faster builds, offering much quicker server start-up and refresh rates. It leads to higher developer productivity and faster iteration cycles, which are crucial for large-scale applications.</li>
                        <li>Server Actions (Stable) streamlines server-side logic, allowing functions to run securely on the server. It simplifies data mutation workflows and strengthens application security. And we all know how important it is for handling sensitive data and complex state management scenarios.</li>
                        <li>Partial Prerendering (Preview) merges the benefits of SSR, SSG, and ISR. It enables quick initial static loading with dynamic content streaming. And any provider of apps requiring both fast loading times and dynamic content rendering loves it.</li>
                        <li>Metadata Improvements: Next js 14 automates the inclusion of essential metadata in the initial page load, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices and themes.</li>
                        <li>App Router: A real star among these improvements! It changes the routing system in Next.js framework, and supports advanced features like nested routes and layouts. It's a more flexible and powerful way to structure applications, crucial for large-scale and complex web projects.</li>
                    </ul>
